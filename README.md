# A JavaScript Trading Bot

It is the intention of this project to automate cryptoasset trading.

- Basic beginnings of a trading bot, written in JavaScript, and run using Node.js.
- Three strategies available currently - SMA, MACD and RSI.  Each self contained within their own file.
- More strategies are to be added, along with the ability to self-select your preference.
- All price data is currently self-generated through random number generation.  It was initially pulled from an API, however for testing it is self generated.
- Buy/Sell orders are conducted using false values, and are not yet linked to an exchange API as yet either.

Disclaimer: The project is being built purely as a learning tool, to aid in the understanding of JavaScript and its associated parts.  I will not be held liable for any other individual or organisations use of this code.
